This repository contains the code Shiny App I created using R with RStudio.

With this app you can create millions of unique patterns. 

The story behind is Phyllotaxis. Creating patterns resembling structures such as Sunflowers, Dandelions etc. 
Creating data points with mathematical formulas and visualizing them with ggplot2.
