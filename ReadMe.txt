This repository contains the code for the Shiny App I created using R.

With this app you can create millions of unique patterns. 

The story behind is Phyllotaxis. Creating patterns resembling structures found in nature such as in Sunflowers, Dandelions etc. 
Creating data points with mathematical formulas and visualizing them with ggplot2.
